# Input file for WC98 Dataset

Download all the files in [this url](ftp://ita.ee.lbl.gov/traces/WorldCup/) and place them here. 
Then, make the ita_tools to get the binary files and run the `load_convert.py` file.
It will automatically convert and merge all the files to get the invocation count for each minute of the day. In case more fine-grained info is necessary,
it can be done with minor modifications in the `load_convert.py` file.
